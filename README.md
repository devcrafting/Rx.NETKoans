# Rx.NETKoans

## Welcome to the Reactive Extensions .NET Koans
_"Learn by Doing"_

### 55 progressive examples to help you learn [Reactive Extensions](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions)

**Definition of ‘Koan’**

[Kōan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C5%8Dan) is a zen word meaning the enlightenment or awakening of a person, usually through a puzzle or riddle. The most common one is “What is the sound of one hand clapping?”

**What is this all about?**

[Reactive Extensions](http://reactivex.io/) is an innovative way to work with asynchronous operations on event streams. It is composable and uses well-known LINQ syntax to easily express complex timing and event processing operations.

The RxKoans are an interactive and fun way to be introduced to and learn Rx.

These Koans target [Rx.NET](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/Rx.NET). There are also JavaScript koans available at [RxJSKoans](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJSKoans)

### Getting Started

Open the Visual Studio Solution, and open the file:

   `Koans\Lessons\Lesson0Lambdas.cs`

Press `Ctrl+R, T` (not `Ctrl+R, Ctrl+T` - see below). Fill in the blank (____) Run it again to see it pass.

After you finish the first Lesson, move to the other LessonX files.

### Running Koans

`Ctrl R, T` will run the koans. It will run either the single koan your cursor is on, or the whole file, if your cursor is not in a specific koan.

### Running in Debug Mode

`Ctrl R, Ctrl T` will run in Debug mode, we do not suggest
this, as it just makes things slower and more confusing.

_Note_: `Crtl+R, T` also takes the current cursor position as a parameter as to which test to run.

### Tips & Tricks

**Play**: Experimentation is a powerful learning tool. Don't be afraid to try stuff out and run it to see what happens.

**Run the Test:** It is valuable to see what the results are. All Koans are designed to produce something even before they are filled in.

**Debug:** Set some break points and walk through the code. It's a great way to get details. `Ctrl+R, Ctrl+T` will run in debug mode.

**Do Them with a Friend:** Learning is more fun and less frustrating when you have a friend with you.
